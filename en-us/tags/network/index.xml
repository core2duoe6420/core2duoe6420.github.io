&lt;p>My dad recently retired and has nothing much to do at home. For some reason he’s started to enjoy watching multiple videos at the same time on his PC, and asked me if it’s possible to watch TV channels (mainly Five Star Sports) on the computer. I’d seen some public IPTV channel lists that can be played directly with Potplayer, and I also knew there are solutions to forward China Telecom’s IPTV to a PC, but since I don’t watch TV myself I never had the motivation to tinker with it. Recently I finally gave it a try.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
