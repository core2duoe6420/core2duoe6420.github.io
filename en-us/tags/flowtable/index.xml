&lt;p>Ran into yet another pitfall. This time it happened when I tried to migrate my original Proxmox VM ImmortalWrt (a build of OpenWrt) into Docker while keeping the IP address unchanged. This ImmortalWrt instance is running my WireGuard service. The migration itself went smoothly. After starting the Docker container, ping worked fine, and my phone could connect to WireGuard. Only one always-on 24/7 node stubbornly refused to connect: no handshake, WireGuard showed 0 KB received, not a single packet came in.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
