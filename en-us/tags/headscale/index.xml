&lt;p>My private home network originally used Zerotier, but I found the connection to be unstable. Even when both of my nodes had public IPs, they sometimes failed to connect. Later I switched to WireGuard, which turned out to be very stable. Recently, however, I bought several new VPS instances and a friend’s home network also joined mine. The number of nodes increased, security rules became more complex, and maintaining WireGuard started to feel overwhelming. So I finally decided to deploy Headscale and migrate to a Tailscale-based network.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
