&lt;p>The subtitle of this post could be “My Hacky Docker Networking Setup”. It mainly describes the pitfalls I ran into when configuring Docker to bridge to the host network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Docker’s bridge network is an internal network; all communication with the outside world has to go through L3 routing and NAT, which is inconvenient for some applications. If you want to bridge to the host network, the simplest approach is to use macvlan. However, macvlan has the drawback that it cannot communicate with the host, so it’s not a perfect solution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dockerfile Pitfalls</title><link>https://blog.hljin.net/en-us/2022/03/dockerfile-issues/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.hljin.net/en-us/2022/03/dockerfile-issues/</guid><description>&lt;div class="alert warning ">

&lt;p>Recently I’ve been writing Dockerfiles at work to build an image that contains a conda environment. I ran into countless pitfalls and can only lament my lack of skill; I’m recording them here.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enable TLS Connection for Docker Daemon</title><link>https://blog.hljin.net/en-us/2022/02/docker-daemon-tls/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.hljin.net/en-us/2022/02/docker-daemon-tls/</guid><description>&lt;div class="alert warning ">

&lt;p>Background: The NAS uses a Xeon W-2140B CPU without an integrated GPU, and the onboard ASPEED graphics is essentially unusable for hardware acceleration, so Jellyfin cannot use hardware decoding. Although I tested that CPU software decoding can handle one 4K-to-4K transcoding stream smoothly, the CPU usage is already close to 100%. So I decided to move Jellyfin to an Ubuntu VM running on ESXi with a Core i3 8100T. To conveniently manage Docker on both machines, I want the Portainer instance running on the NAS to connect to the new Docker Daemon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Docker DNS Troubleshooting Story</title><link>https://blog.hljin.net/en-us/2020/02/docker-dns-troubleshooting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.hljin.net/en-us/2020/02/docker-dns-troubleshooting/</guid><description>&lt;div class="alert warning ">

&lt;p>This afternoon a colleague came to me with a problem: a container couldn’t resolve domain names. I thought DNS issues wouldn’t be hard to fix… and then spent the next 8 hours troubleshooting.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
