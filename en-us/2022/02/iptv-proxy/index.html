For some reason he’s started to enjoy watching multiple videos at the same time on his PC, and asked me if it’s possible to watch TV channels (mainly Five Star Sports) on the computer. I’d seen some public IPTV channel lists that can be played directly with Potplayer, and I also knew there are solutions to forward China Telecom’s IPTV to a PC, but since I don’t watch TV myself I never had the motivation to tinker with it. Recently I finally gave it a try.</p><p>The simplest solution is undoubtedly to find a public IPTV playlist online. For example, this one <a href=https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv>https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv</a> is truly impressive, it has almost all TV channels worldwide. Unfortunately, several key channels stutter badly and the viewing experience is terrible. So I had to mess around with China Telecom’s IPTV.</p><p>The basic principle isn’t complicated either: as long as you have an interface joined to VLAN 85 and obtain an IP via DHCP, you can access China Telecom’s IPTV private network. The next step is figuring out how to let the PC receive IGMP traffic.</p><h2 id=obtaining-a-privatenetwork-ip>Obtaining a private‑network IP</h2><p>At home, the current network setup is that the optical modem is set to bridge mode, and all ports on the modem are bound to VLAN 85:</p><p><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/core2duoe6420/image/upload/v1643914587/posts/iptv-proxy/1643886244221_f3mmhk.png alt=1643886244221></p><p>PPPoE is handled by a soft router, the WAN port is named <code>eth3</code>, and the software is Koolshare’s <code>LEDE v2.37</code>. Add the following lines to the network configuration in <code>LEDE</code>:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>config interface &#39;VLAN85&#39;
	option proto &#39;dhcp&#39;
	option ifname &#39;eth3.85&#39;
        option defaultroute &#39;0&#39;
	option multipath &#39;off&#39;
	option peerdns &#39;0&#39;
</code></pre><p>After saving, you’ll see the new interface automatically obtains a private‑network IP from China Telecom:</p><p><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/core2duoe6420/image/upload/v1643914804/posts/iptv-proxy/1643914741498_pa5kqi.jpg alt=1643886480817></p><h2 id=obtaining-iptv-traffic>Obtaining IPTV traffic</h2><p>Information online about this part is really messy. Many articles mix several methods together, which is completely unnecessary. I’ve summarized things and there are actually three main methods; any one of them can be used to watch IPTV. Of course, each has its pros and cons:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Address format when using this method</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>udpxy</code></td><td>Use HTTP unicast <code>http://192.168.1.1:4022/udp/239.45.3.210:5140</code></td><td>Easy to configure, no broadcast storm</td><td>Channel switching latency is relatively long</td></tr><tr><td><code>igmpproxy</code></td><td>Use RTP multicast <code>rtp://239.45.3.210:5140</code></td><td>Short channel switching latency</td><td>Even with <code>IGMP Snooping</code> enabled, if downstream devices don’t support it you’ll still get broadcast storms</td></tr><tr><td>Use catch‑up addresses</td><td>Use RTSP unicast <code>rtsp://124.75.34.37:554/PLTV/...434_0.smil</code></td><td>Supports catch‑up (replay)</td><td>Channels that don’t support catch‑up cannot be watched</td></tr></tbody></table><p>I tried all three methods. Below is a brief description of the configuration process.</p><h3 id=udpxy>udpxy</h3><p>The principle of <code>udpxy</code> is that it listens on a port using HTTP, parses the multicast address and interface to connect to based on the URL rules, and then forwards the traffic. The address here will be the IGMP multicast address of the IPTV channel.</p><p><code>Openwrt</code> has very good support for <code>udpxy</code>. First install it with:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>opkg update
opkg install udpxy luci-app-udpxy
</code></pre><p>Then edit <code>/etc/config/udpxy</code>:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>config udpxy
        option respawn &#39;1&#39;
        option verbose &#39;0&#39;
        option status &#39;1&#39;
        option port &#39;4022&#39;
        option disabled &#39;0&#39;
        option bind &#39;br-lan&#39;
        option source &#39;eth3.85&#39;
</code></pre><p>The key options here are <code>bind</code> and <code>source</code>. <code>bind</code> is the internal (LAN) interface to listen on, and <code>source</code> is the interface that has the private‑network IP configured. After <code>udpxy</code> starts, you can check its status via <code>http://192.168.1.254:4022/status</code>.</p><p>Another advantage of using <code>udpxy</code> is that you hardly need to touch the firewall. You don’t need forwarding support, you don’t need NAT on the private‑network interface; you only need to allow inbound from the LAN (which is usually enabled, otherwise you couldn’t access <code>LEDE</code> at all).</p><p>After configuration, you can try opening an address with Potplayer to see if it plays.</p><h3 id=catchup-addresses>Catch‑up addresses</h3><p>This method mainly comes from <a href=https://github.com/lucifersun/China-Telecom-ShangHai-IPTV-list>this repository</a>. A few years ago the addresses in this repo seemed to be accessible from the public internet, meaning anyone with internet access could watch them. Later they were blocked by China Telecom and can now only be accessed through the IPTV private network. Also, these addresses are not live streams but catch‑up streams, so we don’t know how much delay there actually is. The following explanation is quoted directly from the author:</p><blockquote><p>This playlist uses the IPTV channel catch-up (time-shift) function. IPTV live streaming uses private-network multicast and cannot be played directly over the Internet. Since not all channels support catch-up, the channels in this list are necessarily fewer than the IPTV live channels.</p></blockquote><p>The principle of this method is simple: we just need to route the relevant IPs via the IPTV private network.</p><p>First, in the <code>LEDE</code> firewall, enable “IP masquerading” (NAT) for the private network, and set forwarding to “accept”. Set forwarding from LAN to the private network to “accept” as well.</p><p>Then add several routes to make these addresses go through the IPTV private network instead of the default gateway. The command format is as follows:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>ip route add 124.75.34.0/24 via 23.x.x.x dev eth3.85
</code></pre><p>The <code>124.75.34.0/24</code> part has many entries and needs to be collected by using Wireshark to capture packets while following redirects again and again. I only tested a single channel, which redirected twice, so I ended up with three addresses. Some addresses are summarized in <a href=https://github.com/lucifersun/China-Telecom-ShangHai-IPTV-list/issues/28>this Issue</a> and can be used as a reference.</p><p>The <code>23.x.x.x</code> part should be replaced with the private‑network gateway. This information should normally be obtained via DHCP, but I couldn’t find the DHCP logs, so I had to rely on blind guessing—using the highest address, i.e. broadcast-1 in the local subnet—and it actually worked.</p><p>To put this method into formal use still requires some engineering work, such as collecting IP ranges and writing a script to handle changes to the DHCP‑obtained address, so I won’t be using it in practice.</p><h3 id=igmpproxy>igmpproxy</h3><p>This method cost me a lot of time. Its general principle is described quite clearly in the <a href=https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/wan/udp_multicast>Openwrt documentation</a>. Roughly speaking, you run <code>igmpproxy</code> on the router; it uses a <code>raw socket</code> to listen to all packets with IP protocol <code>2 (IGMP)</code>. When it detects a packet requesting to join a multicast group, it sends a join packet to the private network on behalf of the client and adds a route entry for that group; the rest of the traffic is then handled by the routing table.</p><p>First install it:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>opkg update
opkg install igmpproxy
</code></pre><p>Then edit the configuration file <code>/etc/config/igmpproxy</code>:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>config igmpproxy
        option quickleave 1

config phyint
        option network VLAN85
        option zone VLAN85
        option direction upstream
        list altnet 0.0.0.0/0

config phyint
        option network lan
        option zone lan
        option direction downstream
        list whitelist 239.45.0.0/16 # see below
</code></pre><p>Finally, start it using <code>service igmpproxy restart</code>.</p><p>This configuration file is described in detail in the documentation. The <code>zone</code> option cannot be omitted, because the startup script uses this field to add several iptables rules so that UDP traffic can pass through properly.</p><p>On the firewall side, this method doesn’t require IP masquerading (NAT). Under normal circumstances, forwarding rules will be added to the firewall when <code>igmpproxy</code> starts (it must be started via the script). If it still doesn’t work properly, you can try enabling forwarding between the LAN and the private network.</p><p>After configuration, opening <code>rtp://239.45.3.210:5140</code> with Potplayer should work.</p><p>Now to talk about the pitfalls of this method.</p><p>First, there’s the issue mentioned in <a href=https://github.com/pali/igmpproxy/issues/61>this Issue</a>: <del><code>igmpproxy</code> seems to forward <code>224.0.0.0/24</code> traffic, which is local traffic and shouldn’t be forwarded</del> (correction: although it’s logged, that address range should be ignored). The latest version of <code>igmpproxy</code> has added support for a <code>whitelist</code> configuration, which is the line I added above. However, the <code>Openwrt</code> configuration tools don’t support this option, so adding that line is effectively useless. <del>This problem led to another issue where Velop stopped recognizing the network and the indicator light turned red (though internet connectivity itself was fine). The Linksys software is garbage.</del> (Update on Feb 5: this issue has been resolved and was not caused by <code>igmpproxy</code>; see <a href=https://blog.hljin.net/en-us/2022/02/velop-red-issue/>this article</a>)</p><p>Second is the reason I ended up tinkering for so long, though it isn’t really a problem with <code>igmpproxy</code> itself but with my PC. When <code>IGMP</code> joins a multicast group, the client sends a Membership Report packet, like this:</p><p><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/core2duoe6420/image/upload/v1643914587/posts/iptv-proxy/1643890616060_gvmmpg.png alt=1643890616060></p><p>However, on my PC this packet simply would not be sent. I used a virtual machine to boot up a Windows and an Ubuntu instance, and testing finally confirmed it wasn’t a configuration issue with <code>igmpproxy</code>, because the VMs worked fine while the host machine itself refused to send the packet. Turning off Windows Firewall didn’t help either. This issue remains unresolved; I don’t feel like tinkering with it anymore.</p><h2 id=epg-and-kodi>EPG and KODI</h2><p>In the end I decided to stick with the <code>udpxy</code> method. During my research I found people mentioning EPG, short for Electronic Program Guide, which can be combined with KODI to achieve a pretty nice result:</p><p><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/core2duoe6420/image/upload/v1643914588/posts/iptv-proxy/1643890989724_jgk2ex.png alt=1643890989724></p><p>This is mostly configuration work.
